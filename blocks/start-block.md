## What You'll Learn 

- What a Start block is and how they work
- How the Start block works within flows


## What Are Start Blocks?
The Start block is the most vital block in your project ⏤ it's so special that it can't be deleted. This is the block that starts your project once the invocation name is called. You can think of the Start block as the jumping-off point for your Alexa skill ⏤ every time a user opens your skill, they start from the Start block (Session Management is an exception).

## How Do Start Blocks Work?
When a user starts your skill, they will always begin at the start block. The start block does not actually do anything that the user will see, it is simply the place where your project begins. You will need to connect the start block to other blocks in order to start your skill. 

## Multiple Start Blocks In One Project
Each flow has one Start block which cannot be deleted. While this means that your project can have several start blocks, the start block in your HOME flow is what your user triggers when they launch their project. Start blocks within flows are the starting point when you enter a particular subflow.


## Start Block Deletion
The start block cannot be deleted and holds no other information other than a note telling you to connect it to your first block.

## Disconnected Start Blocks
If the start block is not connected to anything, the project will automatically close when opened.
